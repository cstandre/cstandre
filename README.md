Hello, I'm Caitlyn, a full stack software engineer driven by the art of turning code into impactful solutions. My background in operations analysis has refined my SQL skills, enabling precise and prompt client request delivery. Collaborating with stakeholders to streamline processes has been a constant theme in my journey, now fueling my software engineering career.

I thrive on translating concepts into reality through code and enjoy unraveling complex bugs. My true passion lies in the creative essence of coding and the fulfillment of witnessing projects come to fruition.

Beyond coding, I find solace in my favorite game, Breath of the Wild, or challenge my mind with Sudoku puzzles. My creativity extends to crocheting, and I savor life's pleasures in good food and live music, often enjoyed with friends.

Let's collaboratively shape innovation and forge new paths.

During my time at App Academy, I tackled three dynamic projects, utilizing a versatile set of tools and languages.
